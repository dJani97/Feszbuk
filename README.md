<h1>Feszbuk</h1>

This is a school project for practicing C#, and Object Orientated Programming.
The project is supposed to simulate a mini social-network, with a lot of working functionality.

 - view profiles
 - sent messages
 - add other people (who are not your friends yet)
 - export data to a file
 - load data from file (although this happens automatically)
 - select language (English or Hungarian)
